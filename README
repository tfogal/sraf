This is a repository of simple code to get data in and out of SCENE's format.

The user of the code needs to include only "sraf.h", and that is the only
interface to the library.  Everything else is internal.

Using the interface is fairly simple.  See "driver.c" for an example, but
basically:

  1. allocate a scene SRA object.
  2. add any number of images or meshes to it
  3. clean up your SRA object.

In detail, assuming you have your data in a bunch of std::vectors:

  struct sraf* obj = sc_allocate("dummy.sraf");
  /* .. generate mesh */
  sc_add_mesh(obj, &vertices[0], vertices.size(),
              &normals[0], normals.size(),
              &texcoords[0], texcoords.size(),
              &colors[0], colors.size(),
              &indices[0], indices.size());
  sc_free(obj);

the above would create a SRAF file which contains a single mesh.
